#Thanks!

**People**<br>
Many thanks to all of the people who gave feedback, particularly David Fifield, who found several annoying issues with an early version. (And who has seriously *legit* musical taste).

Jonah Sheridan has been a huge help with documentation and strategizing.

[Katie Krauss](https://twitter.com/aidspol) offered great advice early on, and recommended a feature to alert users that their selection was downloading. (Which is not obvious after clicking, since any progress meter happens in a regular Chrome window).

And as always, thanks to those who *must* remain anonymous, for taking the time to test against filters and give usability feedback. :love_letter:

Also thanks to Redacted, for answering my question about SHA256sum checking at LibrePlanet. Truly, your help has been redacted redacted.  Redacted!
